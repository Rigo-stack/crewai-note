# NoteCrew

## Description

This app, hosted in Streamlit, uses CrewAI agents to structure information into easy-to-review notes. The inputs for the app are text, PDF, or DOCX files.


##  Problem Statement
Like many college students, I have notes scattered across Google Docs, PDFs, Notion pages, and even screenshots of notes I was too lazy to re-copy. Now, you can extract the text using screenshots, as it has become a cool feature(wondering how? It usesÂ OCR (Optical Character Recognition)).

But once the text is extracted, arranging it, fact-checking that you wrote the correct statement, and formatting it into clear, structured notes is still time-consuming. Instead of doing that manually, why not let a team of AI agents handle all that work?

### Features:
- Multi-Format Input Support: Process notes from PDFs, Google Docs, plain text
- AgentÂ -Powered Note Structuring: Automatically formats your notes into popular study structures: Cornell, Outline, or Boxing method
- Grammar EnhancementL: Identifies and corrects grammar issues for improved clarity
- Fact-Checking: validate key facts in your notes for accuracy
- Optional Flashcard Generation: Converts your content into Q&A-style flashcards to help with active recall and better studying.




### Information Flow

- If the input is not direct text, the app extracts it from the uploaded file.
- The extracted or pasted text is passed to a crew of AI agents.
- The agents process the input sequentially, each performing a distinct part in preparing the final structured notes.

### Agents

- **Grammar Agent**: Corrects grammar and writing inconsistencies in the input.
- **Fact-check Agent**: Validates the factual accuracy of the content.
- **Format Agent**: Applies a selected note-taking method:
  - Outline Method
  - Cornell Method
  - Boxing Method
- **(Optional) Flashcards Agent**: Creates 5 to 15 flashcards summarizing key facts and concepts from the input text.
