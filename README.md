# Agent-Noteâ€“Composition

## Description

This app, hosted in Streamlit, uses CrewAI agents to structure information into easy-to-review notes. The inputs for the app are text, PDF, or DOCX files.



### Information Flow

- If the input is not direct text, the app extracts it from the uploaded file.
- The extracted or pasted text is passed to a crew of AI agents.
- The agents process the input sequentially, each performing a distinct part in preparing the final structured notes.

### Agents

- **Grammar Agent**: Corrects grammar and writing inconsistencies in the input.
- **Fact-check Agent**: Validates the factual accuracy of the content.
- **Format Agent**: Applies a selected note-taking method:
  - Outline Method
  - Cornell Method
  - Boxing Method
- **(Optional) Flashcards Agent**: Creates 5 to 15 flashcards summarizing key facts and concepts from the input text.

## Technologies

- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent orchestration framework
- **Streamlit**: User interface and structured Markdown output
- **PyPDF2**: Extracts text from PDF files
- **docx2txt**: Extracts text from Word documents
- **litellm**: Lightweight wrapper to call LLMs like OpenAI
- **python-dotenv**: Loads environment variables for API key management
