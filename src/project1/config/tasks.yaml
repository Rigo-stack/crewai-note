    Convert the following raw notes into a structured outline using the Outline Method format.

    {notes}

    The Outline Method is a hierarchical note-taking system where main topics are aligned to the left, and supporting details are nested underneath using indentation. Follow these formatting rules:
    - Main points should be labeled as numbered headings (## [1. Topic Name]).
    - Supporting ideas should be bullet points under the heading.
    - Sub-details or examples should be indented further as nested bullet points.

    Use the following **Markdown** structure:
    ## [1. Main Topic]  
    - [Brief description or key idea]  
    - [Supporting detail or explanation]  
      - [Optional sub-detail or example]

    ## [2. Next Topic]  
    - [Key point]  
      - [Subpoint]  
      - [Subpoint]

    ## [3. Another Topic]  
    - [Summary of concept]  
    - [Real-world application or example]

    ## [4. Final Topic]  
    - [Challenges / Pros / Cons / Impacts]

    Your output MUST be a clean, well-organized **Markdown** document using this layout.
