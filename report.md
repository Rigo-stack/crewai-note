## Notes
- **Definition of AI Agent**: An AI agent is an autonomous system capable of perceiving its environment through sensors or data inputs, reasoning about what it perceives, and taking actions through actuators to achieve specific goals. 
- **Processes**: These agents operate in continuous processes of observation, decision-making, and action, allowing them to adapt over time based on feedback from their environment, enhancing their effectiveness in achieving defined objectives.
- **Types of AI Agents**: 
  - **Reflex Agents**: 
    - The simplest forms, responding to immediate stimuli without retaining internal memory of prior states (basic reflex agents).
    - Model-based reflex agents can retain a history of prior states to improve decision-making.
  - **Goal-Based Agents**: These plan actions based on desired outcomes, assessing potential courses of action to achieve set goals.
  - **Utility-Based Agents**: They evaluate actions based on expected utility or value, aiming to maximize overall satisfaction or benefit.
  - **Learning Agents**: These agents utilize various machine learning techniques to continuously improve performance over time through data from previous experiences, adapting strategies in dynamic environments.
- **Applications of AI Agents**: AI agents are integral to modern technology, widely used in applications such as virtual assistants, recommendation systems, smart home devices, and autonomous vehicles. They significantly contribute to the advancement of AI systems, providing functionality and efficiency across various fields.

## Summary
AI agents are autonomous systems that process environmental data and execute actions to achieve specific goals. They come in several types: reflex, goal-based, utility-based, and learning agents, each with distinct decision-making capabilities. They have become essential in numerous applications, including virtual assistants and autonomous vehicles, facilitating advancements in AI technologies.
